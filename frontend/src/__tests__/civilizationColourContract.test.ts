/**
 * `app/globals.css` is the authority for colour. This file makes that true.
 *
 * `lib/chart-colors.ts` exists for a real reason — Recharts props take concrete
 * values and cannot read CSS custom properties — but it was held to the tokens
 * by nothing except a `KEEP IN SYNC` comment, and that comment failed twice
 * without anyone noticing:
 *
 *   - `STATE_COLORS.JUDGING` was still `38 92% 50%`, the accent amber that a
 *     whole restyle had deliberately moved JUDGING off because it collided with
 *     every button and link. The live token is `20 88% 58%`.
 *   - `DISPOSED` and `REINCARNATING` were still `220 80% 62%` and
 *     `217 91% 60%` — the near-identical pair of blues that existed *before*
 *     DISPOSED was moved to purple so PURGATORY could take the blue. Charts
 *     were drawing two lifecycle states 3° apart.
 *   - `ALIVE` and `LOST` were also pre-split values (`160 84% 39%`, `0 0% 50%`).
 *   - `CIVILIZATION_COLORS` mirrored `--color-civ-cn/-eu/-eg`, three tokens
 *     that no longer exist under any name, and had no Greek entry at all.
 *
 * Every one of those is the same failure: a comment makes a claim on behalf of
 * code nobody re-derives. So this test re-derives it. It parses globals.css and
 * compares **in both directions** — a token with no mirror entry is as red as a
 * mirror entry with no token — because one-directional checks are how the
 * fourth civilization stayed invisible in the first place.
 *
 * No DOM and no browser: a file read and two regexes, the same technique
 * `backend/apps/ledger/test_readings.py::TestFrontendMemberListsAgree` uses to
 * hold the two ends of the ledger payload together.
 *
 * SCOPE. This file covers the two tables keyed by a *domain enumeration* —
 * civilizations and lifecycle states — and the `[data-civ]` wiring that makes
 * the civilization tokens paint anything. `chartColourContract.test.ts` covers
 * the other three (REALM_COLORS, CHART_SERIES, CHART_CHROME), which were never
 * mirrors at all. Both import their parser from `./support/globalsCssTokens`
 * rather than each carrying a copy: two regex readers of one stylesheet is the
 * same defect these tests exist to close.
